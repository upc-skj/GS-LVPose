# 3D Gaussian Splatting for Sparse View Pose Estimation

This repository will contain the implementation of our method for camera pose estimation using 3D Gaussian Splatting under sparse view conditions. We are currently organizing and cleaning up the code for release. The final version will be uploaded shortly.
